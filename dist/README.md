## Description

I wanted to make a simple site to see the current and 5-day forecast.
I wanted to practice my programming skills and have easy access to weather data.
Not knowing the current or 5-day forecast of a city you are in or plan to visit.
There a lot more that goes into what can seem to be a simple project.
